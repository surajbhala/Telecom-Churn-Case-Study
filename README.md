# Telecom-Churn-Case-Study
To identify and prevent customers from churning (leaving the mobile network)
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In 
this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it 
costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than 
customer acquisition.
The goal of this case study is to identify the high-paying customers who are at high risk of churn based on usage data for 3months .
Various techniques such as Decision Trees Classifier, Random Forest Classifier , Boosting techniques such as XGBOOST were used to identify the various factors which are indicative of churn.
Important factors were identified and reported which were clear indicative of churn so that the company can take timely action in terms of some offers /discounts or calling the customers to get to know there concerns thereby preventing the churn.
